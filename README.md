## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Apps:
- calculator- The calculator application is simple and clean. I like how you can extend the functionality by easily changing the rotation of the phone
- Messages- Best messaging app out there. Clean interface and the functionality is amazing. Its great!
- Fitness- I use it all the time. The data that it tracks is very helpful, the UI is clean and also importantly it loads very quickly
- Weather- This application is just too important for me not to have and its one of the reasons I keep my phone on me all the time  

App Ideas:
- The app I would like to build would query different databases around the world looking for the latest information on what the current power output is per city (of a given list of cities). 
  - It would be fun to have a real-time update of which cities were utilizing the most power, maybe having the cities show up on a moving or sliding scale showing which one is utilizing the most off of the grid. 
  - There would also be a time series graph showing the average utilization fo the top 10 cities over a week, month, and year
  - The application would give projections on what the output would be if those cities added solar arrays (in specific quantities) to their grids

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I had a bit of difficulty figuring out how to actually run the simulator simply because I didn't see the "play" button in the IDE. After finding this it was smooth sailing.
